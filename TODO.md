Design
- [ ] Look into using table vs. grid for displaying URL previews
- [ ] Desktop vs mobile styling (30vw vs 100vw)

Architecture
- [ ] How to keep track of Are.na channels selected for each URL? Maybe use an object?

Functionality
- [ ] Validate URLs using Puppeteer
- [ ] Process button just adds new website to the end (save previous 'process' list and diff results)
- [ ] Squash URL title and actual url (match with index of processedURLs)

Types
- [ ] Type Channel
- [ ] Type User

Expansion
- [ ] Split searching of channels

Storage
- [ ] Save username and token to storage (also explore saving channels? need refresh?)
